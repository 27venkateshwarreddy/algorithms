Write an algorithm for driving from your place to your favourite destination.

Start: Begin at your current location.
Input Destination: Enter the address or coordinates of your favorite destination.
Plan Route: Use a mapping service or GPS navigation system to determine the best route to your destination. Consider factors like traffic, road closures, and construction.
Follow Directions: Follow the directions provided by the mapping service, observing traffic signs and signals along the way.
Adapt to Changes: Be prepared to adapt to changes in the route due to traffic conditions or road closures. The mapping service may provide alternative routes if necessary.
Drive Safely: Observe speed limits, yield to pedestrians, and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.
Arrive at Destination: Continue following the directions until you reach your favorite destination.
End: Once you arrive at your destination, your journey is complete.

Write an algorithm for Registration and login into your websites.
Registration:

User Input: Collect user information such as username, email, and password.
Validate Input: Check if the username and email are unique and meet the required format (e.g., valid email format). Ensure that the password meets security requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
Store Data: Save the user information securely in a database, encrypting sensitive information like passwords.
Confirmation: Optionally, send a confirmation email to the user to verify their email address.
Registration Complete: Inform the user that registration was successful and provide instructions on how to proceed to login.
Login:

User Input: Collect username/email and password from the user.
Verify Credentials: Check if the entered username/email exists in the database. If found, retrieve the corresponding password.
Authenticate: Compare the entered password with the stored password for the user. If they match, proceed to login.
Session Management: Create a session for the user to maintain their login status throughout their visit to the website.
Login Successful: Redirect the user to their dashboard or designated landing page upon successful login.
Handle Invalid Credentials: If the username/email or password is incorrect, notify the user and provide options for password reset or registration.
Logout: Provide an option for the user to log out, which destroys their session and logs them out of the website.

write an algorithm to check if a number is negative or positive:

1. *Input*: Obtain the number to be checked.
2. *Check Sign*:
   - If the number is greater than zero, it's positive.
   - If the number is less than zero, it's negative.
   - If the number is exactly zero, it's neither positive nor negative.
3. *Output*: Return the result indicating whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

Pseudocode:


function checkSign(number):
    if number > 0:
        return "Positive"
    else if number < 0:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Zero"

number = input("Enter a number: ")
result = checkSign(number)
print("The number is", result)


The sign of the number and returns whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

1. *Input*: Obtain the number to be checked.
2. *Check for Special Cases*:
   - If the number is less than 2, it's not prime.
   - If the number is exactly 2, it's prime.
3. *Check Divisibility*: 
   - Iterate from 2 to the square root of the number.
   - If the number is divisible by any integer in this range, it's not prime.
4. *Output*: Return whether the number is prime or not.

Pseudocode:


function isPrime(number):
    if number < 2:
        return false
    else if number == 2:
        return true
    else:
        for i from 2 to floor(sqrt(number)):
            if number % i == 0:
                return false
        return true

number = input("Enter a number: ")
if isPrime(number):
    print(number, "is prime.")
else:
    print(number, "is not prime.")

write an algorithm to check if a number is an Armstrong number:

 Declare Variable sum, temp, num
 Initialize Variable sum=0 and temp=num
 Repeat Until num>=0
             sum=sum + cube of last digit i.e [(num%10)*(num%10)*(num%10)]
             num=num/10
 IF sum==temp
            Print "Armstrong Number"
        ELSE 
            Print "Not Armstrong Number"

Write an algorithm to check if a year is leap year or not.

1. Start
2. Input the year to be checked (year)
3. If year is evenly divisible by 4, then
    If year is evenly divisible by 100, then
        If year is evenly divisible by 400, then
            Print "Leap year"
         Else
            Print "Not a leap year"
    Else
        Print "Leap year"
4. Else
    Print "Not a leap year"
5. End

This algorithm follows the rules to determine leap years:

If a year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
However, if that year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless:
It is divisible by 400, in which case it is still a leap year.
